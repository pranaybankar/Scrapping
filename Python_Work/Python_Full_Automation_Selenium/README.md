Please put the chromedriver.exe inside the C:\Python n.n\Scrpits Folder if the driver.FireFox() is not working. I have used Chrome() driver as my FireFox driver was pursuing problem.

**Requirement:** 

Write a crawler for Expedia.com . We need the below mentioned data in MongoDB (preferred else use any other db) for Row NYC Hotel:- link

**Scarpping**

- Hotel Name
- Hotel Rating
- Reviews
- All Room Types and Their Rates
- Date of Stay
- Timestamp of the data scraped
- Log of data change (If I scrape the same hotel again and if the Room Rate is different from the last one then store the timestamp. Every time there is change in rates it should log the timestamp here. It could be a list of timestamps.)

**Expected Data on Dates:**

You need to get all these data from 21st of May, 2016 to 25th of May, 2016 (There is will be 6 stay dates for this. So, 5 records expected) for each date.

**Disclaimer:** This is just a practice & study purpose web scrapping. There is no intention to hurt any organisation or person.
